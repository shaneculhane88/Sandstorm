I am watching this new series called Workaholics and I'm really enjoying it.
It's about 3 guys who are a bunch of wasters that smoke weed and drink the whole time while also working for a telemarketing company.
Their names are Adam, Blake and Anders and they are hilarious.
they live in a town called rancho cucamunga which is in California.
They have no respect for anyone but themselves and how they treat others is hilarious.
